\title{Rboretum Tree Dater}
\usage{
treeDater(tree, calibration_df, iterations)
}
\arguments{
\item{tree}{Tree(s) to extract date information from. Options include:
\itemize{
  \item A single, rooted phylo object; or,
  \item A rooted multiPhylo object where all trees share 3+ taxa and support a single topology 
}}

\item{calibration_df}{Dataframe with 4 columns: (1) Taxon 1 (2) Taxon 2 (3) Min divergence time (4) Max divergence time}

\item{iterations}{How many times to estimate the age of each node prior to summarizing [Default: 1000]}
}
\value{
An ultrametric phylo object with branch lengths corresponding to time, or a multiPhylo of such trees
}
\description{
This function takes a tree(s) with estimated branch lengths, and infers ages for each tree node using the 'chronos' function in 'ape'.
}
